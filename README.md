Coursera John Hopkins JavaScript module-4 Greetings Challenge : https://jean-joooo.github.io/module4-solution/ -------> and check the console

In this JavaScript programming exercise, I delved into practicing fundamental concepts. The task involved looping over an array of names, utilizing two externally provided libraries to print greetings to the browser console.

Key Objectives
Loop through an array of names.
Print "Goodbye JSomeName" for names starting with 'j' or 'J'.
Print "Hello SomeName" for names starting with other letters.

Implementation
Leveraged JavaScript to iterate through the array of names.
Utilized conditional statements to determine appropriate greetings based on name characteristics.
Applied problem-solving skills to fix code in externally provided libraries for seamless execution.

This exercise provided hands-on experience in applying JavaScript fundamentals and problem-solving skills. Practicing the correction of code in external libraries enhanced understanding and proficiency. Feel free to explore the code and dive into the world of JavaScript programming!
